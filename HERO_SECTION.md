# Modern Animated Hero Section

This Hero section has been completely redesigned with modern animations and styling using React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## Features

- **Glassmorphism Buttons**: Modern glass-effect buttons with backdrop blur
- **Animated Background Blobs**: Floating colorful blobs that move subtly in the background

### ðŸŽ¬ Animations (Framer Motion)

### ðŸ“± Responsive Design

1. **Container fades in** (0.2s delay)
2. **Name appears** (0.5s delay)
3. **Role title appears** (0.8s delay)
4. **Description appears** (1.1s delay)
5. **Buttons appear** (1.4s delay)
6. **Scroll indicator appears** (1.5s delay)

## Customization

### Colors
- Primary gradient: Purple to Pink (`from-purple-600 to-pink-600`)
- Background gradient: Blue to Purple (`#667eea` to `#764ba2`)
- Name gradient: Yellow to Pink to Purple (`from-yellow-400 via-pink-500 to-purple-600`)

### Animation Timings
You can adjust animation timings by modifying the `transition` objects in the animation variants:

```javascript
const itemVariants = {
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    transition: {
      duration: 0.8, // Change this value
      ease: "easeOut"
    }
  }
};
```

### Text Content
Update the text content directly in the JSX:
- **Name**: Lines 112-117
- **Role**: Lines 121-126
- **Description**: Lines 129-135
